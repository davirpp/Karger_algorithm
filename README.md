# A Jupyter Notebook explaining the Karger's Algorithm
What if you have to separate people that are connected in 2 groups, how can you make that? Imagine that the connection between the people is a graph, doing that, you have an algorithm to help you with this problem!

On [this](https://github.com/davirpp/Karger_algorithm/blob/main/Kargers_Algorithm.ipynb) notebook you'll understand the problem to create this algorithm and two solutions are demonstrated: The Karger's algorithm and a fully randomic algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem, and in the end, analyze their perfomances.

Enjoy the notebook!
