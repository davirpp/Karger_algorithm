# A Jupyter Notebook explaining the Karger's Algorithm
What if you have to separate people that are connected in 2 groups, how can you make that? Imagine that the people's connection is a graph, doing that, you have an algorithm to help you with this problem!

On that notebook you'll understand the problem to create this algorithm and is demonstrated two solutions, the Karger's algorithm and a fully randomic algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem, and in the end, analyze their perfomances.

Enjoy the notebook!
